MAIN FANDOMS : HSR, GI , ALNST , DANGANRONPA , YTTD, STRANGER THINGS (I also know a lot of fandoms, but I'm mostly focused on hoyo games)

I don't usually say anything, but I like to just sit next to someone , so C+H pls

friendly . don't be afraid to sit next to me or say something to me, but English is not my first language and therefore I will not conduct a dialogue very well
