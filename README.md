i don't really want to share my info, so just call me by the name of the character I'm cosplaying

INFP , melancholic any pronouns . you can just use the pronouns of the character I'm cosplaying or she/her

MAIN FANDOMS : HSR, GI , ALNST , DANGANRONPA , YTTD, STRANGER THINGS (I also know a lot of fandoms, but I'm mostly focused on hoyo games)

I don't usually say anything, but I like to just sit next to someone , so C+H pls

friendly . don't be afraid to sit next to me or say something to me, but English is not my first language and therefore I will not conduct a dialogue very well

PPL UNDER 12 YEARS OLD DNI I don't really care about other things ok
